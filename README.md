Scripts
=======
That obligatory repo everyone has that contains a load of personal stuff that isn't really useful to anyone else.
 - `./install` contains some bash scripts that are a prototype for universally installing packages on systems, TBH I am thinking of replacing that with some sort of machine rebuild tool for servers, as my script is horrible. Don't use it.
 - `./c_headers` contains c headers
 - `SEGFAULT.bashrc` is my bashrc backup. 
 - `sketch_runner.py` is a python interpreter for reading badly written python sketches. That has been replaced with a full project at: https://github.com/IGBC/PySketch
